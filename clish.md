# CLISH #

A modular framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX system. Arbitary command menus and actions can be defined using XML files. This software handles the user interaction, and forks the appropriate system commands to perform any actions.

The clish was developed by [Graeme McKerrell](gmckerrell.md).
